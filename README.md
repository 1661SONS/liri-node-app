# LIRI, a Node App

## LIRI is like SIRI, but less obnoxious.

### It's a Node app that runs in the terminal // command line and can print tweets from @MadamnMarkdown, print Spotify song info of the user's choice, and print movie data of the user's choice.

### LIRI responds to these commands:

* node liri.js my-tweets

* node liri.js spotify-this-song "TYPE SONG TITLE HERE WITH NO QUOTES"

* node liri.js movie-this "TYPE MOVIE TITLE HERE WITH NO QUOTES"

### If the user is indecisive, they can print the dev defaults using these commands:

* node liri.js spotify-this-song

* node liri.js movie this
